# React Project Template

This template provides a minimal setup to get **React** with **Typescript** working in **Vite**. It comes with the **Chakra UI** component library pre-installed, along with **Prettier** and **ESLint** styling rules. Also recommended to use **yarn** as a package manager.

:large_blue_circle: Chakra UI is a React component library
:purple_circle: Zustand is a small unopinionated state management library
:yellow_circle: Vite is a no-bundler dev environment that supports hot module reloading
:orange_circle: ESLint and Prettier enforce code styles

## Relevant Commands
